    8. An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as
    February 29, and the day is called a leap day. A leap year contains a leap
    day.
    These are the conditions used to identify leap years:
        1. if the year can be evenly divided by 4, it is then a leap year
        2. but if the year is evenly divided by 4 and also by 100, then it is NOT a
        leap year
        3. but if the year is evenly divided by 4 and also by 400, then it is a leap
        year
    This means the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900,
    2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.
    Ask a year input from user. And tell if the year entered by user is leap or
    not.
